# create a znode for every resourse 

resPath = '/app/res'
zk.create(resPath,"ResName")

for lock needed for res
    create(resPath+'/lock-', SEQUENTIAL)

each transaction

for lock in getChildren(resPath,true).sort(asc)
    checkLockPath = resPath+'/'+lock.path+'/isLocked'
    if(!exist(checkLockPath,watch))
        create(checkLockPath,EPHERMAL)
        continue
    else
        break and wait till the watch notification comes and then we create the lock
        that way all processes have to go through the same order of locks for a given resourse and can't acquire any lock
        unless it acquires the one before it.
